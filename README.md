# Terminal-tests
Welcome to terminal tests, where I put all my projects relating to the terminal (and command prompt).

The requirements are: <br>
Windows (sorry mac & linux users")<br>
The Microsoft telnet client<br>
Python 3 <br>
<br>
If you want to run these projects on your pc without downloading them all individually, <br>
You must download the following file <br>
"run.bat"<br>
<br>
When you run the file<br>
It will check if you have python installed <br>
If you do, it will connect to and run the "run.py" file in the repo.<br>
If not, it will take you to the microsoft store page to download python<br>
